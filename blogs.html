					<h4>Four Most Provoking Stages Of Life!</h4>

					<h4>Four-step simple process for every single human being's life is Expansion, Boom, Recession and
						Depression.</h4>
					<br>
					<b>
						1. Expansion</b><br>
					It means there will be a time when you will start your business or like anything in your life in
					the span of '20-'30s, where you promote your product and want to sell as much as possible. But,
					not earning as expected.
					It is just like, let's say startup, where you won't have the connected customer to sell and
					no-one is interested in your product. Although your product is unique and you are working your
					entire day and not getting a single penny, Guys remember coca-cola sold only 25 bottles the
					first year. "Patience"
					<br>

					<b>2.Boom</b><br>
					After every expansion BOOM is like an inbuilt product with it. Boom is like, there will be one
					product or one news or one video or one blog, which will be like the most-wanting product or a
					newspaper or a youtube video or a blog in the society and everybody is like crazy for that, at
					that time everything will change.
					At that moment your life will change to the opposite direction, just appreciate your hard work
					and persistence and always try to push out your ego on the way. It ultimately means that do
					smart work and have patience also let your ego buried in between because boom is on your way.
					And as I mentioned it the most damaging because here, there will be a few who builds Ego as
					well, so for that type of person, Reccisseion will be the worst part of life. So, never feel
					like "I am everything".
					<br>

					<b>3.Recession</b><br>
					It is a term which is inevitable in this process, shortly means that once you reached the
					topmost position, God will challenge and check your Ego and patience, by giving you failure and
					setbacks.
					According to the businessman this time which we called "corona pandemic" is they called in their
					words "Recession" because here "better will become the best and worse will be removed".So, this
					is what called "Recession".
					Ultimate information, what I Mean by Receisson waiting for the ego-builder is that in this step
					of the process, they will be dropped on their face on the ground and will not be able to stand
					up. So, practice not to build an "Ego" with your growing business.
					<br>
					<b>4.Depression("The end is The New beginning")</b><br>
					Last and the most dominant step of the entire process for all of us, in here most people get
					depressed because of losing everything in the rescission and disable to stand up once again. The
					only thing that matters is the mindset in this type of situation.
					So, how to overcome this situation?
					This stuff is pretty easy, As I did and most of the productive people did it too, "do not focus
					on what you have lost or what you don't have, try to focus on the things you have accessibility
					on", and start at that right moment from scratch, because in this time even billionaires have to
					start from nothing.
					Never take this situation as granted, just this moment start learning or do anything you are
					interested in, and see the growing result in few months (But it requires intense hard work and
					patience).
					<br>
					In conclusion, The process is never-ending. You will get everything once you started "but"
					detach Ego on the way because if not then recession is yet to come. And always "The End is The
					New Beginning"
					<br>
					<b>I hope you understand deeply about these stages of the life of what I called "Corporate-world
						process".

					<h4>Waiting for Opportunity? Create It! </h4>
					<h5>(3rd paragraph will surely change your mind)</h5> 2min read

						<img src="assets/img/quote.jpg" width="100%">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="col-12 col-md-9"><b>Why we never thought why we are here?</b><br>
					God has designed every single person for many different things. Everyone is born to achieve the
					greatest but, we wait so long to get the opportunity and never tries to take the risk and be the
					top.
					Every single human being on this planet earth had given the same amount of chances but, you have
					never imagined, how worth that single idea is! A single thought made this Disney land(the Walt
					Disney), made this entire world Lightful( Thomas Edison), made our India peaceful(Mahatma
					Gandhi).
					<br>
					<b>Never Ever waits!</b><br>
					A midnight thought is worth more than millions,don't ever think that you don't worth taking this
					step, every single successful person had once taken the risk and had not waited for the
					opportunity, they create it. So, you just have to take a step ahead and grab that opportunity,
					grab it, "GRAB IT".
					If you still think to wait for the opportunity, just understand, God is also more intelligent
					than you, Imagine today night you get the world-changing idea but thought to do it tomorrow and
					not tonight, if you didn't wake up tomorrow you will die with regret. so, just that moment start
					working on it.
					Because boi, no-one never knowns their last night, everyday work like you're going to die
					tomorrow.
					<br>
					<b>I know There Is still 30% of People Waiting for it.</b><br>
					So, there is the only thing I want to say is that your Dreams worth more than you thought of
					because God has chosen you to accomplish that world-changing idea, there are 700 corers people
					on this earth and you are chosen by the creator to create a new era of life, so take action
					otherwise you will not able to die peacefully and who knows it's your last day.
					<br>
					"You are waiting of God to give you an opportunity but God is waiting for you to just start"<br>

					<h4> Process of A Dream To Achievement</h4>
					2 min read

					<div class="img-box">

					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="col-12 col-md-8"><b>Dreams are not Yours.</b><br>
					Firstly, dreams for a human being means that he/she is enthusiastic to achieve a thought in the
					head. So, how does that thought come to their mind suddenly?
					Here comes God, before humans god has the dream to change the world, then lord finds for a DOER, not
					a dreamer and give him a "dream" to accomplish and completely change the lifestyle of everybody
					living in the society.
					<br>
					<b>How does that doer get the help of that dream given by the creator?</b><br>
					So, you all know that if you like to do work on the research you will get anyone who is also of
					similar choice and he/she will be more or less intelligent then you. So, For the knowledge and to
					know the right direction for hard work, The Lord sends an unknown person he never knew of and he/she
					becomes a part of it
					Now onwards, it all comes down onto the doer. He will make a plan of it, he will analyse in detail
					about it, he will get socialize with various people to learn from their experience also, he prays to
					god for better.
					<br>
					<b>The most Interesting Part of The Dream!</b><br>
					Now, He got everything needed and also connect to god by prayer. I think you have thought that he is
					successful till now, but wait, God doesn't give "uncomplicated" success to anyone.
					Remember, he will check your patience and ego(when you be a successful human being) by giving you
					many failures and lots of unimagined obstacles on your way and try to aware you by falling that
					still, you are missing something.
					<br>
					<b>The End Is The Beginning!</b><br>
					As now he achieved what he meant to that doesn't mean he is done (NOO!), he will be given another
					dream and another and another because success is not a destination it is a journey.
					So, this cycle of meeting new persons and getting experience from others, working hard and failure
					and obstacles will take part in this process once more but, now he is familiar with this things so,
					it won't be much difficult.
					<br>
					In conclusion, Dreams are of the god we just make it possible and fame and money are by-products. It
					is great said that "overnight success builts Ego and slow success builds Character." Because
					failures are meant to mould your ego on the way. Everybody gets the opportunity to be great but a
					few are able to grab because remains do not want to pay what it wants( massive hard work and
					patience)."The End Is The New Beginning." try to understand it all because you are going to be
					successful in life.

					<h4>Motivation is within found it out in yourselves!</h4>

				<p class="col-12 col-md-8">
					We think that a person can only start when somebody motivates him that's right, it is just for a
					startup then onwards you have to motivate yourself by achieving minor goals each day because that's
					the only thing which sets you to do further.

					So, Finding out it in yourselves is the best thing, the reason is, once you started giving small
					milestone every single day gradually you will make a winning mindset and lead to achieve higher
					goals.

					A startup is like, you born today you will not be able to eat a lot from day one, because first you
					have to be familiar with the thing and eventually u will start eating a lot compared to your
					childhood, so winning mindset is build up just like that.
					<br><b> Why be punctual with work once started?</b><br>
					Most importantly, have patient, and guts to take risks wherever needed, then it comes to the work
					ethic because how u make money is more important than how much u make- @garyvee

					Remember, when you will start from nowhere there will be lots of setbacks, so don't get demotivated
					learn from it try to solve it out. Ask yourself how, why and where changes are needed and overcome
					those failures and if it seems to be time-consuming, without any hesitation go for it.
					<br>
					<b>4. NEVER GIVE UP!</b><br>
					Never think of surrendering, understand if Thomas Edison had not try again and again for 10,000
					times, we were still living in the dark. So, you had allowed achieving more than you thought of.
					"every problem is an opportunity" that's how all things were discovered.
					losing is never an option.
